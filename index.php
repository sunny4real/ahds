			<abbr title="Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland">AHDS</abbr> is a modern forward thinking union working for you. We are geared for the twenty&#8211;first century, but we have all the background knowledge and experience you would expect from a union that has represented school leaders for over 30 years.</p><br> 
			AHDS is dedicated to school leaders &#8211; we are the only real option if you want your union to properly represent the perspective of heads, deputes and principal teachers from nursery, primary and <abbr title="Additional Support Needs">ASN</abbr> schools around Scotland. If you are a member of a class teacher union and you run into conflict with a teacher who is also a member of that union the likelihood is that you will not receive support &#8211; despite paying your dues. We are here to support you.</p><br>
			The Scottish Government announced today that it would support an additional in&#8211;service day for Primaries. This was in response to consensus support from the <abbr title="Curriculum for Excellence">CfE</abbr> Management Board (on which AHDS is a member).</p><br>
			The <abbr title="Educational Institute of Scotland">EIS</abbr> had brought this issue to the Management Board in the past but at that point AHDS did not support in&#8211;service days as the best way forward, instead we had proposed that additional resources be made available for schools to allow the release of groups of staff to undertake specific pieces of work for their establishment or cluster. However, as this had not taken place and in response to changing circumstances, National Executive agreed that AHDS should change its position to support an additional in-service day.</p><br>
			Primary school teachers are to be offered an additional in&#8211;service day to help them build on the excellent work going on in Scotland&#8216;s classrooms.
			Minister for Learning, Science and Scotland&#8216;s Languages Alasdair Allan announced the additional in&#8211;service day following discussions with teaching unions, education organisations and parents&#8216; groups, following a request from the EIS and <abbr title="National Parent Forum for Scotland">NPFS</abbr>.
