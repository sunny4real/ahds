		<h3>About AHDS</h3>
		Established in 1975, <abbr title="Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland">AHDS</abbr> is a trade union for Headteachers, 
		Deputes and Principal Teachers from nursery, primary and special schools in Scotland.We are a modern, forward thinking,
		organisation with all the background knowledge and experience you would expect from a union that has represented school 
		leaders for over 30 years.We run professional and successful campaigns on a range of issues. We work in partnership with 
		the Scottish Government and local authorities as well as other key players in Scottish Education to represent the interests
		of our membership in the development of education policy and practice.</p><br>Our goal is to ensure that our Members get a good deal
		as employees and that Scotland&#8216;s children get the best deal possible throughout their education. We also organise a programme
		of training and events targeted specifically at school leaders.  This comprises of a range of day conferences, training days, 
		sectoral meetings and our two day annual conference.  While all but the sectoral meetings and our annual conference are open 
		to non&#8211;members there are significant discounts for members &#8211; often bringing the price to attend lower that the cost of running the event.
		Some events are free and for the sectoral meetings we even pay travel expenses.</p><br>We have extremely positive feedback about our 
		training and events with many delegates noting that they can&#8216;t get training targeted at them as school leaders anywhere else &#8211; let
		alone at the low prices charged. In addition we provide professional advice and legal support for our members should they ever need to call upon it.
		(Take me to the <a href="supports.php"><span>&lsquo;Support&rsquo;</span></a> page) AHDS has no political affiliation nor is it a member of the <abbr title="Scottish Trades Union Congress">STUC</abbr>.</p>

		<h3>Successful Campaigns</h3> 
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>We have long argued that the 5&#8211;14 curriculum was too prescriptive and restrictive for primary professionals. We have also, over the years, put a great emphasis on the importance of early years. While not alone in making these points we feel we have won the argument with the advent of the 3&#8211;18 curriculum, A Curriculum for Excellence.</li></p>
			<li>In the run up to the Scottish elections in 2007 we campaigned on four main issues: protection of nursery education; management time for school leaders; free school meals; and inclusion. Most of these points featured in the manifestos of all the main parties. The current Government has a very strong focus on pre&#8211;school and early years of primary &#8211; we continue to work with them on this.</li></p>
			<li>Since the advent of job&#8211;sizing we have been highlighting the inconsistency of application, anomalies and secrecy of the job&#8211;sizing toolkit. At the start of 2008 the <abbr title="Scottish National Test Centre">SNTC</abbr> started a review of the guidance relating to the application of the toolkit. We view this as a promising development and continue to press for a full review.</li>
