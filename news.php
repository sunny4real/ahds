	<h3>News</h3>
	The Scottish Government announced today that it would support an additional in-service day for Primaries.  This was in response to consensus support from the <abbr title="Curriculum for Excellence">CfE</abbr> Management Board (on which <abbr title="Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland">AHDS</abbr> is a member).</p><br/>
	The <abbr title="Educational Institute of Scotland">EIS</abbr> had brought this issue to the Management Board in the past but at that point AHDS did not support in&#8211;service days as the best way forward, instead we had proposed that additional resources be made available for schools to allow the release of groups of staff to undertake specific pieces of work for their establishment or cluster.  However, as this had not taken place and in response to changing circumstances, National Executive agreed that AHDS should change its position to support an additional in-service day.  In reaching this decision Executive recognised that the considerable difficulty being faced by members seeking to secure supply teachers meant that, in the current circumstances, an in&#8211;service day was the only route to be sure of additional development time for members.</p><br/>
	It is expected that the additional day should be on the same day as the already arranged additional day for secondaries in the new session.  This means the timing of the day will vary from local authority to local authority.  You should hear more about arrangements from your local authority soon.</p><br/>
	The full press release from the Scottish Government is available below</p><br/>
	<strong>Dr Allan said:</strong><br/>
	&#8220;I appreciate the understanding of the National Parent Forum who have supported this request.&#8221;<br/>
	&#8220;This has been another exciting year for Scottish education, with Curriculum for Excellence now embedded in Scottish primary schools, improving our children&#8217;s education by offering a more coherent programme of learning.&#8221;</p>

	&#8220;Teachers have been at the forefront of the successes that have been achieved so far. I recognise their work is delivering lasting improvements that will benefit our young people and economy for years to come.&#8221;</p><br/>
	&#8220;The Scottish Government takes support for teachers very seriously and that’s why, despite considerable financial constraints, an unprecedented range of support has been put in place, including more than £10 million of additional funding since 2012.&#8221;</p><br/>
	&#8220;I have worked very closely with teachers&#8217; representatives and local authorities to address any issues around the delivery of teaching in our classrooms. At this important time in the delivery of Curriculum for Excellence, I recognise in-service training is of great benefit to teachers, complementing the range of other support available.&#8221;</p><br />
	&#8220;Following discussions with teaching unions, I am pleased to announce an additional in&#8211;service day will be available to primary teachers in 2014/15. The Scottish Government is committed to working with partners to support teachers and improve the delivery of teaching and learning as much as possible.&#8221;</p><br/>
	<strong>Iain Ellis, Chair of the <abbr title="National Parent Forum for Scotland">NPFS</abbr>, said:</strong><br/>
	&#8220;We have taken the unusual step of supporting this request for an additional in service day for primary schools as we think it is for the benefit of our children. We are keen to see further development of assessment approaches which can be shared with parents to help them understand their child&#8217;s learner journey. To make this easier for parents we would ask that co-ordination of primary and secondary in&#8211;service days is managed locally to help parents.&#8221;</p>
