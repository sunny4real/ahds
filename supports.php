	<h3>Support</h3>
		Often its helpful to seek advice sooner rather than later and talking to an experienced, impartial expert can help you gain insight into the situation and perhaps a new perspective.  If you find yourself in a situation at work where you&#8217;re unsure of your rights or just want to talk it through with a sympathetic listener then give us a call.</p><br/>
		If you are a member of <abbr title="Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland">AHDS</abbr> and need some advice or support there are several options you can try:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your Area Officer is your first point of contact for advice and support.</li>
		<li>If you would prefer to speak to someone outside you local authority area you can contact one of the other Area Officers.</li>
		<li>Or contact us using the email on the <a href="contacts.php"><span>Contact</span></a> page and we will get back to you as soon as possible.</li><br/>
	</ul>
	<p>All support offered by AHDS is offered under our &lsquo;<a href="terms_of_engagement.php"><span>terms of engagement</span></a>&rsquo;.</p><br/>
   </div>

		Please have your membership number to hand when first contacting your Area Officer. If you don&#8217;t know this then contact jessunesho@eshybyte.net or 01224 875 223 to find out.</p><br/>
		If you are not yet a member of AHDS you can join by registering and completing an online Application Form.</p><br/>
		<b>From a current member of AHDS:</b></p>
		<p>&#8216;I really can&#8217;t thank you enough for all the support you have given me over the last 2 years.  I have so appreciated all your kindness, honesty and sense of proportion.  Somehow you helped me to preserve my sanity with your empathy and understanding.&#8217;</p>
