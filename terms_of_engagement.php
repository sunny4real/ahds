		<h3>Terms of Engagement</h3>
		AHDS provides a variety of services to its Members, including the provision of support from a local, area or national AHDS representative at meetings with Local Authorities and, where appropriate, access to legal advice and representation &#8220;Services&#8221;. Such Services are provided on the following terms and conditions:-</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Services will be provided at no cost to the Member.</li><br>
			<li>A decision on whether or not to provide the Services, and at what level will be made by the General Secretary. The General Secretary may terminate the provision of the Services at any stage and, without prejudice to that generality, where the Member is not prepared to accept the advice of the AHDS representative or the Solicitor.</li><br>
			<li>Members are required to cooperate fully with the AHDS representative or the Solicitor and to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts, circumstances and relevant documentation. Failure to do so will result in termination of the provision of the Services.</li>			
		</ul>
	</div>	
		<br>	
	<div class="col-md-6">		
		<ul>
			<li>Members are required to give clear instructions to the AHDS representative or the Solicitor.</li><br>
			<li>Members are prohibited from making statements to the press, the media or on the internet in relation to the provision of the Services without the written authority of the General Secretary and breach of this condition will result in termination of the provision of the Services.</li><br>
		</ul>
		The role of the AHDS representative at such meetings is to provide support. The AHDS representative is not entitled to answer questions on behalf of the Member although he or she is entitled to consult with the Member. The AHDS representative may however address the meeting on behalf of the Member. Where in the course of a hearing or a meeting, a Member thinks it is necessary, he or she should instruct the AHDS to ask for an adjournment of the meeting.</p><br>
		In common with all other unions, AHDS operates a clean sheet policy.  This means that we cannot help with situations which pre&#8211;date your period of membership with AHDS.</p><br>
